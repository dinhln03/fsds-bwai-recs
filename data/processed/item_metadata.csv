It is a good tool to investigate what is happening inside a program, and how the contents inside the memory are changed with the execution of the program.

The main focus of the course is the disassembly of the program, where we'll use simple operations in C. With the help of GDB, we'll examine the contents of the registers and memory. We'll also learn how they are changed while executing basic operations. We’ll then explore the use of pointers, stack, and function parameters, and analyze how different registers update their values. With the help of disassembly output, we’ll learn how a simple C program can be reconstructed. The disassembly output is important for debugging and core dump analysis. We’ll use assembly language for x64 architecture.

By the end of this course, you should be able to debug the programs and memory contents at assembly level when a program executes or probe into the problem when a program crashes.","Gain insights into using GDB for debugging in Linux.

By the end of the course, you’ll have one complete hands-on project in Python added to your profile. That’s a great start!",This course builds a classic Rock Paper Scissors game in Python using a modular programming method for a beginner-level coder.,,beginner,9a1cb6cc-99cd-5b8b-9aa1-d4c03357ef78
The Ultimate Guide to Kotlin Programming,"Kotlin has been growing in popularity among developers for some time. It was given even more recognition when Google announced in 2019 that Kotlin was now their preferred language for Android development. 

In this comprehensive course, you’ll start by learning the fundamentals, such as: how Java and Kotlin differ, how to work with functions, and how to utilize collections, something you’ll work with extensively in Kotlin.

In the latter half of the course, you’ll be introduced to more advanced concepts like lambdas, fluency in Kotlin, and asynchronous programming. In the last section of the course, you’ll take what you’ve learned and build out an Android application that talks to a backend service.

By the time you’re done with this course, you’ll have a thorough mastery of this modern JVM language. This course is based on the PragProg book, Programming Kotlin, written by the extraordinary, experienced programming-language enthusiast: Venkat Subramaniam.","Gain insights into Kotlin, explore differences from Java, work with functions and collections, delve into advanced topics like lambdas and async programming, and build an Android app.",,beginner,d7957da8-84de-5b3c-a84a-5146f432fe64
The Hacker's Guide to Scaling Python,"Python, in all of its greatness, is often dismissed when needing to write performant and distributed applications. It’s considered to be slow and not suited for the task. In this course, you will find that with the right implementation of Python, you can write applications that scale horizontally, perform well, and are distributed. 

To kick things off, you’ll learn about CPU scaling, concurrency, and event loops, all of which are crucial for implementing a distributed system. After that, you’ll move on to queue-based distribution, lock management, and group memberships, which are fundamental concepts for maintaining availability and consistency in distributed applications.

In the last half, you’ll learn how to build a REST API, how to deploy your app to a PaaS, and how to optimize your application's performance.

By the end of this course, you’ll be more productive with Python, you’ll be able to write faster applications that are distributed, and you’ll have a great new skill that is highly coveted.","Learn about Python's scalability, concurrency, and distribution via CPU scaling, event loops, queue-based distribution, and building REST APIs to optimize and deploy high-performance applications.",,advanced,abd68494-750e-5fec-bf10-97602cafa6ba
